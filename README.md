**Alien Invasion**

A classic arcade-style game where the player controls a ship at the bottom of the screen and must defend against an invading alien fleet. When the game begins, a fleet of aliens fills the sky and moves across and down the screen. The player shoots and destroys the aliens. If the player shoots all the aliens, a new fleet appears that moves faster than the previous fleet. If any alien hits the playerâ€™s ship or reaches the bottom of the screen, the player loses a ship. If the player loses three ships, the game ends.
